# First steps in C

This is were my journey with the C language starts at Holberton School. This repository is divised into subprojects of increasing difficulty in C, from very basic to more advanced stuff.

Here are the different projects ordered in time :

- [C - Hello World](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/hello_world) : compilation process, `gcc` command, `puts`, `printf` an `sizeof` operators

- [C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variables_if_else_while) : first time implementing loops and using relational and logical operators

- [C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/functions_nested_loops) : first use of a header file, discovering nested loops

- [C - Makefiles](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/makefiles) : grasp the basics of makefiles

- [C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_functions_nested_loops) : self explanatory

- [C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/pointers_arrays_strings) : how to declare, use and manipulate pointers, arrays and strings

- [C - Recursion](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/recursion) : first time implementing recursive functions, how and when to use recursion

- [C - Static libraries](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/static_libraries) : basics of static libraries

- [C - argc, argv](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/argc_argv) : manipulate argc and argv, `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile with unused arguments

- [C - Malloc, free](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/malloc_free) : automatic and dynamic memory allocation, `malloc` and `free`, `valgrind` for memory leaks

- [C - More malloc, free](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_malloc_free)

- [C - Preprocessor](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/preprocessor) : deeper into the preprocessing step of compilation, how to define, use and manipulate macros, include guards

- [C - Structures, typedef](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/structures_typedef) : define, use and manipulate a structure and its elements, `typedef` to create aliases

- [C - Function pointers](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/function_pointers) : first time using function pointers, this is were I coded my first simplified calculator :sunglasses:

- [C - Variadac functions](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variadic_functions) : first time working with variadic functions, one step closer to making my very own `printf` !

- [C - printf](https://github.com/Teheremiti/holbertonschool-printf) : First group project, implement our own simplified version of `printf` :fire:
